Welcome to the classic Snake Game built using Python and Tkinter! This project is a simple, fun, and educational game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own body while scoring as many points as possible.

## Features

- **Simple Controls:** Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** The snake grows longer each time it eats food, increasing the challenge.
- **Score Tracking:** The current score is displayed at the top of the window.
- **Game Over Screen:** A "Game Over" message appears when the snake collides with itself or the wall.
- **Start Button:** Start the game with a single click.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
   ```
## Run

We can either directly run using the play button on the top of the page.

   ```

## Output

Unlike a normal code game where it is automatically starting and ending I've just added this start button to start or restart the game.
